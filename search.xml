    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Prices, returns, holdings, and portfolios Lotteries and Rewards Prices, returns, holdings, and portfolios all of the techniques we will discuss are actually used in most of the largest investment banks, AM, HF. changes in portfolio holdings are called trades although it wasn’t emphasized in classical studies of portfolio theory, trading itself is a complex process with many decision variables tha need to be considered and potentially optimized. all trading is costly and some putative arbitrage opportunity doesn’t exist at all once costs are properly accounted for. I’ll wager that most quant-oriented hedge funds have only a vague idea of their capacity. Definition 1.1 Bid, Ask. trading equities, cost includes borrow fees if one is selling short, financing costs of leverage. taxes on transaction taxes on dividends commissions small order charges … costs also include things you can not know temp or permanent price impact. one implication of all these cost is that strategies with high turnover and/or requiring leverage must also have extremely accurate forecasts ptip_t^ipti​ is the price for the i-th asset rt+1=pt+1/ptr_{t+1} = p_{t+1} / p_trt+1​=pt+1​/pt​ is the return over the interval [t, t+1] VWAP = volume-weighted average price Definition 1.2 A stock split is an issue of new shares in a company to existing shareholders in proportion to their current holdings. A dividend is a sum of money paid by a company to its shareholders out of its profits or reserves. some measures such as revenues are typically specified as whole-com measure but earnings etc. are often reported as forecasts on a per-share basis those measure are related to split Definition 1.3 bold face notation without a superscript rt+1r_{t+1}rt+1​ denotes as the vector of return. Any structure inherent in the random process driving rt+1r_{t+1}rt+1​ potentially gives rise to analogous structure in the portfolio’s return. Definition 1.4 htih_t^ihti​ is holding at time ttt. hhh will always have units of US dollars. ht∈Rnh_t \in R^nht​∈Rn ht⋅rt+1h_t \cdot r_{t+1}ht​⋅rt+1​ is the P&amp;L Information about cov(rt+1)cov(r_{t+1})cov(rt+1​) gives information about hth_tht​. var(ht⋅rt+1)=ht′cov(rt+1)htvar(h_t \cdot r_{t+1}) = h_t&#x27; cov(r_{t+1}) h_t var(ht​⋅rt+1​)=ht′​cov(rt+1​)ht​ rt+1rfr^{rf}_{t+1}rt+1rf​ is risk-free rates. If the asset returns one is modeling are local currency returns, be careful to use different risk-free rate for diff cur Definition 1.5 Excess returns is rt+1−rt+1rfr_{t+1} - r^{rf}_{t+1} rt+1​−rt+1rf​ which is n×1n\times 1n×1 matrix normality is usually the assumption behind model. Definition 1.6 Sharpe ratio is S=E[r−rfvar(r−rf)]S = \mathbb{E} \left[ \frac{r-r_f}{\sqrt{var(r-r_f)}} \right] S=E[var(r−rf​)​r−rf​​] universal convention: whatever frequency, always use annualized returns and annualized volatility. Sharpe ratio is not the best way for long only fund. Definition 1.7 benchmark long only strategy usually use S&amp;P500 as benchmark Hence a manager’s skill is closely related to performance relative to the appropriate benchmark. For this reason, one often considers the information ratio (IR), which is the same formula as the Sharpe ratio, but with the risk-free rate being replaced by an appropriate benchmark. Lotteries and Rewards A lottery is a probability distribution over the reward space. If u(w)=1−exp(−κw)κu(w) = \frac{1-exp(-κw)}{κ} u(w)=κ1−exp(−κw)​ where κ&gt;0κ &gt; 0κ&gt;0 is some positive scalar, then supposing www is normal, E[u(w)]=1−exp(E[−κw]+V[−κw])κ=1−exp(−κE[w]+κ22V[w])κ=1−exp{−κ(E[w]−κ2V[w])}κ=u(E[w]−κ2V[w])\begin{aligned} \mathbb{E}[u(w)] &amp;= \frac{1-exp(\mathbb{E}[-κw] + \mathbb{V}[-κw])}{κ} \\ &amp;= \frac{1-exp(-κ\mathbb{E}[w] + \frac{κ^2}{2}\mathbb{V}[w])}{κ} \\ &amp;= \frac{1-exp\{-κ(\mathbb{E}[w] - \frac{κ}{2}\mathbb{V}[w])\}}{κ} \\ &amp;= u \left( \mathbb{E}[w]- \frac{κ}{2} \mathbb{V}[w] \right) \\ \end{aligned} E[u(w)]​=κ1−exp(E[−κw]+V[−κw])​=κ1−exp(−κE[w]+2κ2​V[w])​=κ1−exp{−κ(E[w]−2κ​V[w])}​=u(E[w]−2κ​V[w])​ This implies that maximizing E[u(w)]\mathbb{E}[u(w)]E[u(w)] is equivalent to maximizing E[wT]−κ2V[w]\mathbb{E}[wT]- \frac{κ}{2} \mathbb{V}[w]E[wT]−2κ​V[w] since uuu is monotone. It turns out this is true for many fat-tailed distributions as well. Utility Definition 1.8 An agent is risk-averse if, at any wealth level w, she dislikes every lottery with an expected payoﬀ of zero: ∀w,∀z~∀w,∀\tilde{z}∀w,∀z~ with E[z~]=0\mathbb{E}[\tilde{z}] = 0E[z~]=0, E[u(w+z~)]≤u(w).\mathbb{E}[u(w + \tilde{z})] ≤ u(w). E[u(w+z~)]≤u(w). Any lottery ˜ z with non-zero expected payoff can be decomposed into its expected payoff E[˜ z] and a zero-mean lottery. Proposition 1.1 An agent is risk-averse, ie. inequality E[u(w+z~)]≤u(w+E[z~])\mathbb{E}[u(w + \tilde{z})] ≤ u(w + \mathbb{E}[\tilde{z}]) E[u(w+z~)]≤u(w+E[z~]) holds for all www and z~\tilde{z}z~, if and only if u()u()u() is concave.]]></content>

Market participants have adopted the convention that a rally refers to falling interest rates, while a sell off refers to rising rates. principal v.s. notional principal: pricipal is the real money your pay. e.g. you pay 0 for a 100 swap There are a lot of conventions, do not discuss them, just follow them LIBOR ICE LIBOR “At what rate could you borrow funds, were you to do so by asking for and then accepting interbank offers in a reasonable market size just prior to 11 am?” FRAs FRAs are OTC transactions. In a FRA transaction, counterparty A agrees to pay counterparty B LIBOR settling t years from now applied to a specified notional amount (say, $100 mm). In exchange, counterparty B pays counterparty A a pre-agreed interest rate (say, 3:05%) applied to the same notional. Because of their granular structure, they allow one to hedge the exposure or express the view on rates move on specific days. e.g. an FOMC FRA is a FRA which fixes the day after a Federal Open Markets Committee meeting. a turn switch allows to hedge or express the view on the rate spikes idiosyncratic to the month-, quarter- or year-end. Eurodollar futures In many ways, Eurodollar futures are similar to FRAs, except that their terms, such as contract sizes and settlement dates are standardized. -[ ] bond like quoted price -[ ] what is the four serial contracts ED: eurodollar H: March 7: 2017 white, red, green name stand for different pack [ ] why some numbers are white Swaps [ ] what is outstanding notional [ ] forward starting swaps OIS ( overnight indexed swap) OIS is better than LIBOR, because it’s based on sth.

(~ 1 trillion) Fed Fund futures SOFR is based on the volume weighted average of the Treasury repo rate, the rate on overnight loans collateralized by US Government Treasuries. Valuation of swaps Multicurve paradigm [x] why don’t we use LIBOR also as the index rate Because we have a huge amount of LIBOR futures in the market Zero coupon bonds [ ] In practice we are interested in the value P(t; S; T ) of the forward zero coupon bond for any valuation date t ≤ S. It is thus the time t value of zero coupon bond (whose face value is $1) which settles on the date S years from now and matures in T years Forward rates Building the OIS / LIBOR multicurve]]></content>
